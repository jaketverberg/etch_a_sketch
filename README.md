This project is to create an etch-a-sketch using javascript as the source to draw and change how many "pixels" are generated and changing their colors upon the hover motion of the mouse.

Query Selectors were a huge element of this project and helped me understand how to select what I wanted to change or have as a variable in javascript to push what I wanted on screen or to link other causes to occur when something were to happen "On Click" or when a value changed.

Most challenging for me to understand is having an execution function for every time something passes through it, such as "function changeMe (e) => e.target.style.backgroundColor = changed."
